## Code Structure

- api:
  This contains the backend server for the gift store. It's a standard express server with 4 routes
  1. **Create Order** - This endpoint accept order details and the unique transaction reference. The endpoint first verifies the transaction, then if it is successful, it creates an order and marks it as `paid`. If it is not, the order is set to `abandoned`
  2. **List Order** - This endpoint returns all the orders that weâ€™ve saved to the DB, it can be used by an admin interface for viewing orders.
  3. **Create Refund** - This endpoint for the admin dashboard to call Paystack APIs to initiate a refund.
  4. **Webhook** - Lastly, there's the webhook route, the webhook route. This is the URL you set on our Paystack dashboard to receive events and notifications. When the URL receives a request, it first checks the signature header to confirm if the requests are coming from Paystack by validating the hash.
      If this is successful, then it picks the transaction reference and checks if an order has already been created with the reference, if it finds one, the status of the order is updated accordingly.
      On the other hand, if no order is found, it creates a new one and sets the status to `paid`
